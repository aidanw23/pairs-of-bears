# Casscoria


*Casscoria* is a fan-made single page web app for scoring games of the popular board game, Cascadia. Designed to take some of the maths away that slow down the end of the game and ideally make the scoring more accessible to people who may struggle with it.

The app is made in React using no other libraries. It is the first app I've made in React.

Its hosted using Netlify and can be accessed at: https://casscoria.netlify.app/

There are plans already to further improve the app, such as:
 - Rephrasing text for some scoring cards to improve user experience.
 - Adding inputs for player names, instead of the current 'player x' displays.
 - Improve the styling of certain sections of the app.
 
 If you've got feedback, errors in scoring or otherwise want to reach out, you can find me at: swornoaf@outlook.com
